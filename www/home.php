	<h1>ediSustainability — A Passionate Project</h1>
		<p>ediSustainability is a project built with the aim of providing companies and corporations with the necessary information and incentives that support the adoption of environmentally-friendly practices
		<br>reducing carbon emissions. This will primarily be achieved by encouraging and motivating companies to use more ecologically-friendly methods of transportation, but can also include acts such as raising 
		<br>the awareness of sustainability issues and promoting better options and lifestyles within the company at large.
