	<h1>Our Mission Statement</h1>
<p>ediSustainability is a passion project built to support companies throughout Edinburgh and within the whole of Scotland in making the difficult choices: promoting sustainable practices within the workplace that 
<br>both have a lasting positive change both on the environment and within the company. We aim to promote growth and development featuring healthy, sustainability-friendly choices by providing companies 
<br>with the means to easily track their progress and monitor new opportunities and the knowledge necessary to understand what impact their decisions have on both the world and themselves.

<br><br>We have acquired the support of several companies within Edinburgh — and several colleges throughout Scotland — all pledging themselves to similar sustainability principles, and this website will serve 
<br>as a platform to further enhance this growth and positive change. The full list of supporting companies can be found in the 'Corporate Credentials' page.

<br><br>Our aims are to bolster many long-term sustainability values within any supporting company, and can be managed by:
<li><i>
<ul>Our sustainability rubic system which lets companies chart their exact progress.</ul>
<ul>A surplus of information about sustainability practices, viability, consequences, and costs.</ul>
<ul>A group of supporting companies and colleges all working together to the same brighter goal.</ul>
<ul>A place to share feedback, ask questions, and ultimately enhance one's understanding of sustainable choices.</ul>
<ul>The effects good practices have on both the environment and the company as shown through active recycling, etc.</ul>
<ul>— And so much more!</ul>
</i></li>
