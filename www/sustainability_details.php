	<h1>Sustainability Details</h1>
<p>Sustainability is often a <i>catch all</i> phrase referring to a variety of problems. Understanding what sustainability is at its core and its many parts will help you better understand what the 
<br>project is and what its practices can provide to your company. It is:

<h3>A focus on environmentally conscious decisions.</h3>
Importing resources, materials, and goods from different countries might prove a cheaper alternative compared to purchasing these materials locally, but the excessive use of vehicles, planes, and ships 
<br>to handle such vast sums of cargo critically harm both the environment, the climate, and us. Companies should seek to source basic materials and goods locally, first and foremost.

<h3>Consistent and efficient wide-scale recycling.</h3>
Excessive amounts of waste are produced daily across the world by both consumers and companies, wasting a precious opportunity to reuse and recycle otherwise wasted resources. Not only does recycling help 
<br>a company cut down on costs, the effect the process has on the environment and climate change cannot be understated.

<h3>Tackling climate change.</h3>
Climate change has rapidly become the most prominent problem of our era. Without consistent regulations set both by law and a company's own regulations, toxic emissions will eventually lead to long-term
<br> consequences. Short-term issues are already arising throughout the world, from reduced access to water, sweltering heats, and even struggling infrastructure.

<h3>Environmentally-conscious education and training.</h3>
A careful, diligent application of sustainability-related training and education throughout all levels — within schools and within the workplace at large — will provide employees and employers 
<br>alike with the necessary tools to invoke positive change and become a driving force toward sustainable development.

<h3>Conservation of natural resources.</h3>
The mounting effects of climate change are forecast to have extremely hostile effects to the availability of mankind's most basic resource: water. These issues are exasperated by companies 
<br>that primarily dump their waste within the ocean or rivers and by organizations that do not treat it with the proper care and respect.
